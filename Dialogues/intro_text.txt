	Humans crave for new heights, for new purposes. They want to uncover every secret, put light on what is in the shadows.
	They'll light it all until there is no more.
	I've always wondered, why are we like that? Maybe its a lack of purpose. Maybe we feel limited, constrained to our own selves.
	Maybe we want to impress others with our discoveries, beat them, eradicate them until we control the entire world.
	But no one stays on the top of the chain forever.
	As history of the past millenia tells us, civilization tried to reach higher and higher. But as much as the Earth gave them the wind
	and the fuel to fly, she took it all back from them with gravity, erosion, and suffocating heat.
	
	Still, I'm here today, trying to reach the sky once more as my ancesters did. Because the sky is a beautiful dream. No, It's the perfect
	dream. It's so visceral, so intricate. No one can trully escape to it.
	But not everyone gets a chance to fullfil this cursed purpose. Destiny chose me.

	I have to continue now, I can't overthink it, it's too late. I have to stop looking back. 
	Now is time to look up for the wind.
